    <p>Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't. That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10. I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. It’s about making placeholder text great again. That’s what people want, they want placeholder text to be great again.
        
        You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina. The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! Despite the constant negative ipsum covfefe.</p>
